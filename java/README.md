## Linear Equation Solver

First, copy your data from any source -- such as the matrix below
````
1	1	3	3
2	1	1	0
3	1	2	3
````
Then start [solver.jar](https://github.com/maeyler/PlainJava/blob/master/linear/solver.jar?raw=true), or press "New" button if it is already running

Check [sample problems](https://github.com/maeyler/PlainJava/blob/master/linear/sample%20problems.xls?raw=true) for other matrices

Now you may solve the system manually using row operations, or press 's' for a solution

In order to slow down the automated solution, double click on the rows, starting at the top row

**When a row is selected, standard row operations are allowed:**
* e: exchange this row with another row
* m: multiply this row by a rational or decimal number
* a: add to this row a multiple of another row

When a row number is required, you may click on that row
(Data entry is designed for keyboard input)

**Note that rows are numbered from 1**
