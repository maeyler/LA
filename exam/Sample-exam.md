### Two Questions
from the make-up exam
```
2. Consider the least squares problem Ax = b with this data:
   2C=1, -C+D=0, 2D=-1    with x=(C,D)

a) Find the plane W defined by the columns of A
Ans: x+2y-z=0

b) Show that the best solution, projected to W, is (1/3, –1/3)

c) Determine p and e. Hint: e must be orthogonal to W and to p
Ans: e=(1,2,-1)/3  -- compare with (a)

4. An unknown matrix A has three distinct eigenvalues:  0, –1, 2
The eigenvector for λ = 0 is  u = (2, 1, –1).  Determine the following:
a) characteristic equation for A
b) determinant of A
c) trace of A
d) rank of A
e) null space of A  (set of solutions to Ax = 0)
Ans: x=tu for any t
